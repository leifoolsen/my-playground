Material Design (codenamed Quantum Paper) is a design language developed by Google. Expanding upon the "card" motifs 
that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and 
transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesnâ€™t rely on any JavaScript 
frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use,  and offer an experience that is immediately accessible
