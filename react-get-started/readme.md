# Get started with React

```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --progress --colors
```

npm i babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev (is not installed. do we need it in Babel6?)

## How should we structure our code

Like this?

```
|
+-- src
|   +-- scripts
|   |   +-- components
|   |   +-- lib
|   |   +-- mixins
|   +-- stylesheets
|   |   +-- components
|   |   +-- lib
|   |   +-- mixins
+-- tests
|   +-- unit
|   |   +-- components
|   |   +-- lib
|   |   +-- mixins
```
