```

+-- src
|   +-- html
|   +-- js
|   |   +-- actions
|   |   +-- components
|   |   +-- constants
|   |   +-- dispatcher
|   |   +-- stores
|   +-- stylesheets
|   |   +-- base
|   |   +-- components
|   |   +-- layout
|   |   +-- pages
|   |   +-- themes
|   |   +-- utils
|   |   +-- vendor
+-- test
